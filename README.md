# üêç 30 Days Of Python 


## Hello!

I would like to state that I have participated in the 30 Days of Python programming challenge and I am working on learning Python. This challenge provides an opportunity to learn everything needed to become a Python programmer, including the fundamental concepts of programming. At the end of the challenge, I will receive a 30DaysOfPython programming challenge certificate.

If you would like to actively engage in the challenge, you can join the [30DaysOfPython](https://t.me/ThirtyDaysOfPython) challenge Telegram group.

My goal is to complete the tasks given within the challenge every day and improve my Python skills. During this process, I will strive to learn the fundamentals of software development in Python, practice coding, and acquire new skills.

I am excited to embark on this thrilling journey. I hope to make significant progress in Python programming and develop new projects during these 30 days.
