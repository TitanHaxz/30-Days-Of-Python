# 30 Days of Python - Day 1

This is the report of my work for Day 1 of the 30 Days of Python challenge.

## Python Version

- Python version used: Python 3.9.5

## Operations

I performed the following operations in the Python interactive shell:

- Addition (+): 3 + 4 = 7
- Subtraction (-): 3 - 4 = -1
- Multiplication (*): 3 * 4 = 12
- Modulus (%): 3 % 4 = 3
- Division (/): 3 / 4 = 0.75
- Exponential (**): 3 ** 4 = 81
- Floor Division Operator (//): 3 // 4 = 0

## Strings

I wrote the following strings in the Python interactive shell:

- Name: [Your Name]
- Family Name: [Your Family Name]
- Country: [Your Country]
- Message: "I am enjoying 30 days of python"

## Data Types

I checked the data types of the following data in the Python interactive shell:

- 10: int
- 9.8: float
- 3.14: float
- 4 - 4j: complex
- ['Asabeneh', 'Python', 'Finland'] : list
- Name: str

## Level 2

I created a folder named day_1 inside the 30DaysOfPython folder. Inside the day_1 folder, I created a Python file named helloworld.py. I repeated questions 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the helloworld.py file. I navigated to the directory where I saved the file and ran it using the command `python helloworld.py`.
